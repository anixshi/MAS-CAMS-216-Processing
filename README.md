# MAS-CAMS-216-Processing
Processing Assignments for MAS/CAMS 216 (Creative Media Manipulation) (Taken Fall 2018)

From Course Browser: 
"The arts and humanities are infused with media, from the printed word 
to digital images, videos, and sound. Knowing how these media are 
constructed at a fundamental material level means that one can be 
an active producer of digital artifacts, rather than a passive 
consumer who cedes creative control to someone else. In this course 
students will learn programming skills that allow them to create and 
manipulate images, text, video, sound, and the physical world. 
Programming languages and environments may include Processing, 
Python, Arduino, and Lilypad. Lectures, assignments, and programming 
experiments will ensure that all students understand the material 
regardless of experience or background. We will regularly illustrate 
the intersection of the arts and humanities with computation and 
digital technologies through the reading of historical texts and 
the close examination of specific works. Skills learned in the 
course will be useful for future work in the digital humanities 
among other domains."
